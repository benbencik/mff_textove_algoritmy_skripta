# Project: Text Algorithms Study Materials

This project aims to create study materials for the "Text Algorithms" course taught at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague (MFF CUNI).

## Goal

The primary goal is to produce high-quality study materials in English (B1/B2 level) for each topic covered in the course. These outputs are store in the `notes/` directory.

## Source Materials

The foundation for these materials will be the lecture presentations located in the `lectures/` directory. Each presentation corresponds to a specific topic within the subject.

## Output Format

The final study materials will be written in [Typst](httpshttps://typst.app/), a modern typesetting system designed for scientific and technical documentation. Each lecture should be converted into a single file that are later joined/included together. The central document buildable to pdf should have corresponding title, list of contents and all the chapters.

## Scope of Work

1.  **Process each presentation:** Go through the PDF presentations in the `lectures/` directory one by one.
2.  **Extract key concepts:** Identify and summarize the core algorithms, data structures, and theoretical concepts from each presentation.
3.  **Translate and simplify:** Rewrite the extracted information in clear and concise B1/B2 level English.
4.  **Structure the content:** Organize the material in a logical way, suitable for study.
5.  **Format in Typst:** Create a `.typ` file for each topic, formatting the content using Typst's syntax.

## Process

Always generate a single lecture only (you may use previous lectures as a reference).

## Versioning

After every significant change, a new git commit should be created. The lectures folder should not be versioned.
