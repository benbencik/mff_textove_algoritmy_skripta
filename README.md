# Text Algorithms Study Materials

This project contains study materials for the "Text Algorithms" course taught at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague (MFF CUNI).

The goal of this project is to create high-quality lecture notes for each topic covered in the course.

## Source Materials

The foundation for these materials are the lecture presentations from the "Text Algorithms" course at MFF CUNI.

## How to Build

To compile the project and generate the `main.pdf` file, you need to have [Typst](https://typst.app/) installed. Then, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
typst compile main.typ
```

This will create the `main.pdf` file in the root directory.

Alternatively, you can download the latest version of the PDF from the [GitHub Actions artifacts](https.github.com/actions).

## Disclaimer

These materials are created with the help of an AI model and are intended for study purposes only. They may not be a perfect representation of the original lectures and may contain errors. Please use them in conjunction with the official course materials.
